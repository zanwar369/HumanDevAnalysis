Our interactive component was built upon [a basic plot from the D3.js Graph Gallery](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/connectedscatter_select.html). To err on the side of simplicity, "Inequality in Income (%)" was not included in the interactive component since from our analysis, it had the least importance and also had moderate correlation with "Inequality Adjusted Income Index" which is included.
