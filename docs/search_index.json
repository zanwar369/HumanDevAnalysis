Human development data are versatile and extensive, allowing analysis of a variety of variables across time and region. These datasets have been used in a wide variety of research, and continue to be used in international aid and development analyses, benchmarking, trend analysis in the fields of nutrition, gender, economic and social progress, and much more. As an example, see this paper. This study investigates the relationships between selected Human Security, Inequality, and Education variables to identify associations between individual variables and isolate trends among country clusters. As the breadth of the human development datasets is extensive, this study does not present a deep dive into any one country or region, though regional analysis is suggested as a dimension of further research. Rather, this study provides an overview of the trends and associations between selected variables, draws observational conclusions regarding their relationships, and uses these analyses to suggest directions for further research. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources Note: For this project, data was extracted on around November 20, 2020. There was a significant update to the database sometime around December 16, 2020 with the release of the 2020 Human Development Report. Changes include, but were not limited to, adding 2019 human development data, updating computation methodology of certain indices (which caused slight changes to pre-existing values), and adding/removing features for certain indicators. This report is consistent with the state of the database prior to the update, and where applicable, hyperlinks in the follow sections direct to the archived version of the pages (as of November 24-25, 2020) referenced by this report. The data used for this project is downloaded directly from the United Nations Development Programme - Human Development Reports website. As noted above, this links to the archived version of the website used for this report and will take a few minutes to load. The live version of this website is here. The United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP) Human Development Report Office (HDRO) compiles this data for the purpose of tracking human wellbeing in countries around the world. This data is used extensively by the HDRO in its (near) annual Human Development Report (HDR). The report highlights human development in large part using various human development indices (HDI), derived metrics for measuring human development, which take into account factors beyond economics. However, for this project HDI will not be a principal part of the investigation. According to the Human Development Report 2019: Readers Guide, the data used, at least for the 2019 HDR, is collected from international data agencies with the mandate, resources, and expertise to collect national data on specific indicators. Based on the Statistical Acknowledgment section of the guide, the HDR data was aggregated by the HDRO from a large number of organizations that are reputable and specializes in the field from which the data was collected. For the 2019 HDR, these included international agencies like the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and many others. The HDRO also provides contact information, where available, for organizations it sourced HDR data from. The data available for download from UNDPs website linked in the first paragraph consists of 12 different indicators of human development (plus HDI) and for each indicator, there are a number of descriptive features of that indicator for which data is available. For example, there are 9 features which fall under the Demography indicator, ranging from Median age (years) to Young age (0-14) dependency ratio (per 100 people ages 15-64). The data for each feature in every indicator was downloaded by first filtering the Dimension drop down menu, then by filtering for the relevant feature in a second drop down menu, and lastly going to Download Data to save the feature data as a .csv file. For each feature, a data table, if available, is provided where the columns include HDI Rank (2018), Country, and one column for every year (i.e. 1990) for which data is aggregated. Every column except Country contains numerical data. The years for which data is available falls in the range from 1990 to 2018. For this project, we will be examining 3 of the 12 indicators: Inequality, Human Security, and Education, which have 15, 7, and 22 features respectively. These features will be investigated in further detail in subsequent sections. Investigation showed that there are a number of issues with this dataset, as summarized below: The Human Development Report 2019: Readers Guide note that due to data accessibility and processing methodology, there may be discrepancies in data between national and international agencies. While the dataset contains data from 1990 to 2018, it does not consistently store data for this timeframe for every feature of every indicator. For example, some features have data going back to 1990 but others only back to 2010. Even within the same indicator, different features show data across different time intervals. For example, some features have data for each year, others every 5 years. Some features do not have data in even time intervals. For example, Prison population (per 100,000 people) has data for years 2003, 2005, 2010, 2011 etc. As detailed in subsequent sections, the proportion of missing data is high for some countries. For certain feature/country combinations, 2018 data was not available and was filled with the data from the most recent available year. It was not explicitly stated in the source documentation, but given that the data is collected from 1990-2018 and aggregated from numerous sources, it is possible that there lacks consistency in data collection and computation of certain metrics over time. For instance, method of calculating the HDI is continuously being adjusted. Additionally, the process of international data collection provides its own set of challenges. The Readers Guide notes that the data are collected from international data agencies with the mandate, resources, and expertise to collect national data on specific indicators, but also (as above) notes the potential for discrepancies. International data collection can be complicated by numerous factors, including variation in infrastructural development, access to technology or stable internet connection, incidence of human rights or humanitarian crises, political violence or instability, and more. As this study focuses on patterns among factor variables, rather than patterns in missing or incomplete country data, we do not specifically address these potential impediments. We posit this trend as an important direction for further research. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Inequality Data Transformation 3.2 Human Security Data Transformation 3.3 Education Data Transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The data transformation work was split into three separate buckets, one for each indicator: Inequality, Human Security, and Education. Data transformation for every indicator was similar to the process shown in detail for Inequality, which is not fully reproduced for the other two indicators for conciseness. 3.1 Inequality Data Transformation The Inequality indicator has 15 features from years 2010 to 2018 (one column per year). However, the data table for 6 of these features were not available for download. The remaining 9 features for which data tables were available and was extracted were: Coefficient of Human Inequality Inequality-adjusted education index Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) Inequality-adjusted income index Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index Inequality in education (%)^ Inequality in income (%)^ Inequality in life expectancy (%) Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%) ^ Data for 2018 is either from 2018 or the latest year available. Note that the column HDI Rank (2018) is kept as a reference column and not for analysis. First, all of the files are read by parsing through the Inequality/inequality_rawdata directory, and using read_csv to read in the relevant raw data files for each variable. The files are read in iteratively such that the data frame for every feature is stored in a R list, creating a list of data frames. After reading in the files, a high level look at the data itself was done. The head and tail of one of the feature data frames, containing data for Inequality in education (%), was printed as a representative sample: ## # A tibble: 6 x 11 ## `HDI Rank (2018)` Country `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017` `2018` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 170 Afghanistan 39.3 39.3 39.3 45.0 44.8 44.8 45.4 45.4 45.4 ## 2 69 Albania 12.7 11.9 11.9 11.9 11.9 11.9 9.1 8.5 12.3 ## 3 82 Algeria .. .. .. .. .. .. 33.7 33.7 33.7 ## 4 36 Andorra .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 9.4 10.0 ## 5 149 Angola 26.2 .. 34.6 34.6 34.6 34.6 34.3 34.3 34.3 ## 6 48 Argentina 12.1 12.1 12.1 8.6 8.1 8.1 6.1 6.2 6.2 ## # A tibble: 6 x 11 ## `HDI Rank (2018)` Country `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017` `2018` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; Small Island Developing States 27.6 29.6 30.1 22.0 21.1 20.5 19.9 19.6 19.7 ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; Organization for Economic Co-operation a~ 8.4 9.0 9.6 10.2 9.5 9.5 10.0 8.3 8.2 ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; World 26.2 26.3 27.0 27.2 26.9 25.9 25.7 22.3 17.4 ## 4 a: See http://hdr.undp.org/en/composite/IHDI for the list of surveys used to~ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 b: Data refer to 2018 or the most recent year available. &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Inspection of the remaining data frame indicate that the last rows for the data frames are every feature are NA. In addition, some data frames have foot notes at the end of the table that was read in as a value in the first column. These rows are removed. The output below shows that the number of rows in the data frame for each feature is different. This implies not every feature has the same list of countries. ## [1] &quot;Coefficient of Human Inequality feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted education index feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted income index feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality in education (%) feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality in income (%) feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality in life expectancy (%) feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%) feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; To investigate this further: ## [1] &quot;Nauru&quot; &quot;Tuvalu&quot; &quot;Korea (Democratic People&#39;s Rep. of)&quot; &quot;Somalia&quot; It looks like these four countries shows up for some features and not others. We can expect a lot of missing data for at least these four countries. The next step is to create a single tidy data frame for Inequality. The data frame for each feature has column headings of 2010 to 2018, which are values, not variables. In addition, each data frame is from the same observational unit (Inequality) and should be in one data frame. To convert the list of data frames created from the initial import from the .csv files into a single tidy data frame, use pivot_longer and full_join to create a tidy data frame. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 72f7e4f1a771a64a8a225ae5eb18f50dc29a7ec0 ## # A tibble: 6 x 12 ## `HDI Rank (2018~ Country Year `Coefficient of~ `Inequality-adj~ `Inequality-adj~ `Inequality-adj~ `Inequality-adj~ `Inequality in ~ `Inequality in ~ `Inequality in ~ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 170 Afghan~ 2010 .. 0.226 .. .. 0.260 39.3 .. 58.8 ## 2 170 Afghan~ 2011 .. 0.227 .. .. 0.314 39.3 .. 50.9 ## 3 170 Afghan~ 2012 .. 0.237 .. .. 0.318 39.3 .. 50.9 ## 4 170 Afghan~ 2013 30.0 0.219 0.333 0.391 0.430 45.0 10.8 34.3 ## 5 170 Afghan~ 2014 30.0 0.223 0.335 0.389 0.434 44.8 10.8 34.3 ## 6 170 Afghan~ 2015 30.4 0.224 0.334 0.388 0.429 44.8 10.8 35.7 ## # ... with 1 more variable: `Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%)` &lt;chr&gt; Note that the columns of tidy data frame are currently all of type &lt;chr&gt; when only Country should be of type &lt;chr&gt;, Year should be of type integer, and the remaining be of type numeric.

This was done in a similar fashion to the inequality, and education data manipulations. This required removing blank columns (which had been left in the .csv files for visual appeal) and renaming columns to prime them for the pivot_longer function. Then, to ensure that all missing data were coded appropriately, a for loop was introduced to convert all numeric data columns in the dataset into numeric type. The result is a tidy dataset of all Human Security variables. First the blank and extraneous rows are removed from each dataset, and the column names are converted to reflect the year each measurement was taken. At this point, a problem became apparent. Though the UN Data website lists both a Refugees dataframe and a Homelessness due to natural disasters dataframe as within the available datasets, there seemed to be no actual data available for either. When the Refugees by country of origin and Homelessness due to natural disasters datasets were downloaded (per the option on the UN Data website), the files, though titled correctly, were copies of the HDI records. Below, the initial row of each dataset is compared to show their similarity. ## Country 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 ## 1 Afghanistan 0.298 0.304 0.312 0.308 0.303 0.327 0.331 0.335 ## 2 Afghanistan 0.298 0.304 0.312 0.308 0.303 0.327 0.331 0.335 A note was sent to the administrators of the UN Data website to alert them to this issue. However, as a result, the Refugees by country of origin and Homelessness from natural disaster datasets were excluded from this study. Next, the numeric data columns are converted to numeric type. Note that all columns are originally in character type. Converting to numeric type both eases analysis and allows the blank entries, denoted as .. to be read as empty (NA). Finally, the data are converted to a tidy format and merged. 3.3 Education Data Transformation The following are the columns in the education dataset: Education Index Expected years of schooling (years) Expected years of schooling, female (years) Expected years of schooling, male (years) Government expenditure on education (% of GDP) Gross enrollment ratio, pre-primary (% of preschool-age children) Gross enrollment ratio, primary (% of primary school-age children) Gross enrollment ratio, secondary (% of secondary school-age children) Gross enrollment ratio, tertiary (% of tertiary school-age children) Literacy rate, adult (% ages 15 and older) Mean years of schooling (years) Mean years of schooling, female(years) Mean years of schooling, male (years) Percentage of primary schools with access to the internet Percentage of secondary schools with access to the internet Population with at least some secondary education (% ages 25 and older) Population with at least some secondary education, female (% ages 25 and older) Population with at least some secondary education, male (% ages 25 and older) Primary school dropout rate (% of primary school cohort) Primary School teachers trained to teach (%) Pupil-teacher ratio, primary school (number of pupils per teacher) Survival rate to the last grade of lower secondary general education (%) Note that the column HDI Rank (2018) is kept as a reference column and not for analysis. In order to read in, and transform the education data, a method similar to the previous two situations is used. Every file is found, and read from the relevant Education directory. With this data we determine the relevant NAs in the files, and code those as such. Similarly, we skip the first lines in the files which are blank. Then we remove any rows that are irrelevant specifically the rows with footnotes. Finally, we remove additional columns, and change data types if necessary, and are then ready to transform the data into tidy format. Once the files are read in correctly we create two separate forms of the education data. One of which is with each variable as a column, and year as its own singular column, utilizing the pivot longer and wider functions. The other method leaves relevant education variables in a singular column, and another column corresponding to their values. While the second format is not necessarily tidy, this format is kept for future use in analysis. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Inequality Missing Data 4.2 Human Security Missing Data 4.3 Education Missing Data", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Inequality Missing Data Below is a bar plot showing the count of missing data per feature. The above shows that for 7 of the 9 Inequality features, 20-25% of entries are missing. As Inequality data includes only 9 years and 9 features, a heatmap is an appropriate tool to visualize combinations of missing data between Year and the different Inequality features, with the goal of identifying trends in proportion of missing data for specific features across years (and vice-versa). The above heatmap is drawn such that the feature with the largest proportion of missing data is at the bottom. From the heatmap, it seems 2011 and 2012 show the highest rates of missing data for every feature except Inequality in life expectancy (%) and Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index. However, note that the proportion of missing data peaks at around 0.3 and most feature-year combinations show a proportion of missing data below 0.2, which is manageable. Below is the aggregate sum of number of missing entries over all features for each country, filtering only the countries with at least one missing entry. 100% of the data is missing for Saint Kitts and Nevis, Liechtenstein, and Dominica. In addition, more than 87.5% of the data is missing for Nauru, Marshall Islands, Andorra, and Tuvalu. All of these countries are extremely small (most are islands); it is possible that Inequality data is not collected nationally and/or data collection is not prioritized by the relevant international organizations. Due to the large volume of countries, a heat map is not an effective way to visualize the relationships between proportion of missing data, countries, and features. Instead, a parallel coordinate plot was drawn to assess the presence of a relationship between features and proportion of missing data for different countries. Most countries appear to not be missing data for Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index and Inequality in life expectancy (%), and when they do, both features are missing in similar proportions. For remaining features, at intervals of around 0.1 from 0 to 1, there are clusters of countries missing that proportion of data for each feature. There are a small number of countries missing data for most to all features (seen as a flat line at the top of the plot). These may be the smaller countries reflected in the bar chart above. For Coefficient of Human Inequality, Overall Loss in HDI due to Inequality (%), and Inequality-Adjusted HDI (IHDI), countries generally miss the same proportion of data for all 3 features, suggesting they may be related. In contrast, countries generally miss the same proportion of data in Inequality-Adjusted Income Index as in Inequality in Income (%), suggesting they may be related. In addition, countries are generally missing as much or less data for these features as they are for Coefficient of Human Inequality, Overall Loss in HDI due to Inequality (%), and Inequality-Adjusted HDI (IHDI). For Inequality-Adjusted Education Index and Inequality in Education (%), countries generally miss the same proportion of data; again, they may be related. 4.2 Human Security Missing Data The following abbreviations will be used for variables examined in this section: Homicide Rate (per 100,000 people) - Homicide.Rate Prison Population (per 100,000 people) - Prison.popn Suicide Rate (Male) (per 100,000 people) - Suicide.rate.M Suicide Rate (Female) (per 100,000 people) - Suicide.rate.F A significant proportion of data in the Human Security dataset is missing. Largely, this seems to be a product of uneven tracking between variables and geographic complications. The dataset shows uneven tracking between variables. For example, Homicide Rate is recorded in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and yearly from 2010 to 2017. Suicide Rate for both males and females, by contrast, was recorded only in the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2016. Below are the years in the Homicide Rate dataset for which data were collected: ## [1] &quot;1990&quot; &quot;1995&quot; &quot;2000&quot; &quot;2005&quot; &quot;2010&quot; &quot;2011&quot; &quot;2012&quot; &quot;2013&quot; &quot;2014&quot; &quot;2015&quot; &quot;2016&quot; &quot;2017&quot; By contrast, Suicide Rate data for both males and females were only collected for the following years: ## [1] &quot;2000&quot; &quot;2010&quot; &quot;2015&quot; &quot;2016&quot; The difference in frequency of data collection between these datasets results in a merged dataframe with a high proportion of missing values. Specifically, the consistency of the Prison Population and Homicide Rate data introduces years into the dataframe for which Suicide Rate shows no recorded data. As a result, Suicide Rate (M) and Suicide Rate (F) are both missing values over more than 60% of the dataset, as shown in the graph below. Alternately, the graph below gives a more accurate picture of the proportion of missing data for each variable. This chart reflects the average proportion of missing data for each variable (across all recorded years and countries). Calculating these proportions separately excludes the empty values introduced by the unequal frequency of data collection between variables. The variables with the greatest proportion of missing data (Prison Population and Homicide Rate) show between 25% and 35% missing data, respectively. The following heatmap shows missing data split by variable. Importantly, the map reflects the entire Human Security dataset, again highlighting trends in missing data due to uneven frequency of data collection. Clearly, Suicide Rate (M) and Suicide Rate (F) are missing the greatest amount of data, though there seems to be relatively little missing data in the reported years. Both Homicide Rate and Prison Population are consistently reported between 2005 and 2017, with slight variations in missing data. Homicide Rate shows no data reported for the year 2003, while Prison Population shows no data before 2003. A number of unique problems may be incurred in the collection of international data, as discussed briefly in the Data chapter. Certain countries or regions may have presented challenges for data collection, given that collection processes relied on state institutions and infrastructure. The Homicide Rate dataset is a particularly demonstrative example. The final entries in the dataset show countries for which there is no recorded homicide data. These countries are: ## [1] &quot;Côte d&#39;Ivoire&quot; &quot;Congo (Democratic Republic of the)&quot; &quot;Congo&quot; &quot;Comoros&quot; ## [5] &quot;Djibouti&quot; &quot;Eritrea&quot; &quot;Ethiopia&quot; &quot;Micronesia (Federated States of)&quot; ## [9] &quot;Gabon&quot; &quot;Guinea&quot; &quot;Gambia&quot; &quot;Equatorial Guinea&quot; ## [13] &quot;Lao People&#39;s Democratic Republic&quot; &quot;Libya&quot; &quot;Madagascar&quot; &quot;Marshall Islands&quot; ## [17] &quot;Mali&quot; &quot;Mauritania&quot; &quot;Nigeria&quot; &quot;Palau&quot; ## [21] &quot;Sudan&quot; &quot;Senegal&quot; &quot;Chad&quot; &quot;Togo&quot; ## [25] &quot;Vanuatu&quot; Of these 24 countries, 20 (Cóte dIvoire, Congo, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Madagascar, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, Chad, Congo [Dem. Republic], Comoros, Eritrea, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Mauritania, Senegal, and Togo) are in Africa. The remaining four (Lao [Peoples Dem. Republic], Vanuatu, Micronesia [Fed. States], the Marshall Islands, and Palau) are small island countries in Oceania. Potential association between geographical region and missing data represents an important direction for further research, and provides an example of possible trends in missing data. The above graph shows the proportion of missing data among the Human Security variables by country. Note that San Marino, Palau, Nauru, and the Marshall Islands are each missing 75% of data. Due to the large volume of countries included in this data, and their alphabetical organizational scheme, a heatmap is not an appropriate visualization tool to examine patterns of missing data by country. 4.3 Education Missing Data There are 82090 missing observations across all Education variables, years, and countries. The following bar chart displays an interesting yet confusing pattern. All countries appear to have between 342 and 638, corresponding to 0.42 and 0.7771958 percent total missing entries. Keeping in mind the data spans 29 years and 22 variables, these measurements seem reasonable, though interestingly there seems to be no apparent overarching pattern between missing observations. Some smaller countries, however, do seem more likely to have missing data. For this analysis, we want the variables with the least missing values across Countries. While the full chart is too large and messy to display, plotting Country versus Variable displays some interesting insights. Overall, some variables can already be narrowed down. For example, variables that show little to no missing data across all countries (such as Education Index, or Mean Years of Schooling) are noteworthy. Among other interesting notes, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia seems to be missing all observationswhich is consistent with the original source data. After a little digging, it seems the countrys inclusion is an oversight; Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was replaced by North Macedonia, and was likely a left over data point. Very few countries reported the percent of students without access to internet, and of the countries that reported, most seem to be highly developed. The percent of the population with at least some secondary education, by contrast, seems to be consistently reported. Breaking down this analysis a little further, the lack of data across countries on a consistent basis before 2010 suggests that analysis should focus on 2010 and later. The data appears to have been released in 5-year increments. The following heatmap was included to display yearly patterns across countries, though its messiness may hinder its readability to a broader audience. We debated whether to keep this chart along with the previous hidden one. But it was argued that the maps allows one to confirm whether there are patterns across countries by year (and variable), and there quite clearly is. Hence, while messy it allows one to observe this important piece of information. It is also quite important to determine missingness across country, the lack of which would hinder ones ability to develop a complete analysis of missings. For examplewhat if there were several countries with missings across year or varriable? One would not be able to observe this clearly like was done for The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Hence it can be argued that for EDA the charts present important information. Interestingly, breaking down the missing variables by year (below) confirms what was seen previously: the most reliable variables seem to be Education Index (EdInd), Mean Years of Schooling (MYSchl), and Expected Years of Schooling (ExpSch; according to the amount of missing data across years), as well as the variable for population with some secondary education (PopSS25U). The following heatmap also suggests data reporting may have lagged, as 2018 data seems to be missing for variables which have otherwise reported more consistent data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Variable Selection 5.2 Education versus Human Security (2010 - 2018) 5.3 Inequality versus Education (2010 - 2018) 5.4 Inequality versus Human Security (2010 - 2018)", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Variable Selection 5.1.1 Inequality Variable Selection From Section 4.0 Missing Data, it was noted (from the Inequality parallel coordinate plot) that the following sets of features have the same proportion of missing data for nearly every country, indicating they may be related: Coefficient of Human Inequality, Overall Loss in HDI due to Inequality (%), and Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) Inequality-Adjusted Income Index and Inequality in Income (%) Inequality-Adjusted Education Index and Inequality in Education (%) Inequality-Adjusted Life Expectancy Index and Inequality in Life Expectancy (%) A scatterplot matrix of all 9 features without the missing data is shown below, so that pairwise correlations between all features can be examined. This analysis begins with the feature groups listed above, with strong relationships in their missing data, then extends to the remaining feature variable pairs. First, note the feature groups where missing data appear to be in equal proportions for most countries: Coefficient of Human Inequality, Overall Loss in HDI due to Inequality (%), and Inequality-Adjusted HDI (IHDI): The three pairwise correlation coefficients between these three features are 0.999, -0.954, and -0.950, showing these three feature are highly correlated when the data is not missing. Inequality-Adjusted Income Index and Inequality in Income (%): Correlation coefficient of -0.644. Despite countries missing data for both feature consistently, the two features do not appear to have as strong of a correlation as other cases discussed. Inequality-Adjusted Education Index and Inequality in Education (%): The correlation coefficient is -0.942, showing that these two features are highly correlated when the data is not missing. Inequality-Adjusted Life Expectancy Index and Inequality in Life Expectancy (%): The correlation coefficient is -0.976, showing that these two features are highly correlated when the data is not missing. On the basis of the results above, the following features can be dropped without significant loss of information: Overall Loss in HDI due to Inequality (%) - due to strong correlation with Coefficient of Human Inequality and the fact both share similar missing patterns. Inequality-Adjusted HDI (IHDI) - highly correlated with multiple features, especially Coefficient of Human Inequality and Overall Loss in HDI due to Inequality (%) (while also sharing the same missing pattern as the latter two). Inequality-Adjusted Education Index - highly correlated with Inequality in Education (%) when data is present and in terms of missing pattern. Inequality-Adjusted Life Expectancy Index - highly correlated with Inequality in Life Expectancy (%) when data is present and in terms of missing pattern. Looking at the pairplot of the 5 remaining variables, note that even though the variables do not share the same missing patterns, Coefficient of Human Inequality is strongly correlated with 3 of the remaining features (absolute correlation coefficient of ~0.9). Therefore, this feature can also be dropped. As a result, the remaining Inequality features kept for analysis with other indicators are: Inequality-Adjusted Income Index Inequality in Income (%) Inequality in Education (%) Inequality in Life Expectancy (%) 5.1.2 Education Variable Selection Initially we pulled only the variables with the least missing data. We then ran ggpairs across these variables to determine if they could be further narrowed in selection. Given that the variables are all relatively highly correlated, it seems Education Index (EdInd) provides the clearest comparison in analysis of correlations across human development topics. Next, in determining how to handle the Year variable, we examine the yearly breakdown after 2010 (as the Inequality dataset only spans 2010-2018). From here, each year appears highly correlated (.985 to .999), suggesting years do not need to be examined individually, and can be aggregated with a simple average. 5.1.3 Human Security Variable Selection The following abbreviations will be used for variables examined in this section: Homicide Rate (per 100,000 people) - Homicide.Rate Prison Population (per 100,000 people) - Prison.popn Suicide Rate (Male) (per 100,000 people) - Suicide.rate.M Suicide Rate (Female) (per 100,000 people) - Suicide.rate.F As noted in section 4, the Suicide Rate data are collected sporadically. While these datasets internally show the lowest proportion of missing data, they only reflect data collected for four years, (2000, 2010, 2015, and 2016) which are not consistently spaced across time. The other datasets in this section (Homicide rate and Prison population) show a higher proportion of missing data, but reflect a larger number of consistently sampled years. Finally, as the Refugees by Country of Origin and Homelessness due to Natural Disasters data are unavailable, they cannot be included in this analysis. The following graph shows the pairwise correlation between all variables in the dataset, with the exception of Refugees by Country of Origin and Homelessness due to Natural Disaster. With the exception of male and female suicide rate (0.552), none of the data show correlation coefficients above 0.5 or below -0.5, indicating they are not highly correlated. As a result, the Human Security variables selected for this study are the following: Homicide Rate (per 100,000 people) Prison Population (per 100,000 people) 5.2 Education versus Human Security (2010 - 2018) For the actual analysis, we compare the average across Education Index (EdInd) against the Human Security variables: Homicide Rate (per 100,000 people) (Homicide.rate) Prison Population (per 100,000 people) (Prison.popn) Here it appears that a high Education Index is associated with low Homicide Rate and Prison Population. Education and Homicides seem to have a direct relation with higher education implying lower homicide rates. Education and Prison Population seem to show a similar relation, though a high Education Index seems to be associated more with a median level of Prison Population. Notably, several countries with high education levels still show higher prison populations. The following scatterplot matrix seems to show the relationship clearly. While higher levels of education are still associated with low Homicide Rates, restricting the analysis to lower levels of education shows an associated jump in high Homicide outliers. As expected the sign here is negative, confirming the likelihood of a negative relation between the variables. The relationship between Education and Prison Population, though is somewhat stronger and more direct, as seen in the matrix, with a correlation of 0.3. Thus, higher levels of education seem to imply higher levels of imprisonment. 5.3 Inequality versus Education (2010 - 2018) This section details the analysis of Inequality versus Education indicators for the selected features: Inequality Inequality-Adjusted Income Index Inequality in Income (%) Inequality in Education (%) Inequality in Life Expectancy (%) Education Education Index Mean Years of Schooling (Years) First, all Inequality variables were compared with all Education variables in a scatterplot faceted by year from 2010 to 2018, as those were the only years with available Inequality data. It was noted that Year did not separate the data, as illustrated in the a sample facet plot below for Mean Year of Schooling versus Inequality in Life Expectancy (%). This was the case for every combination of variables. As there are 6 features in total, all of which are continuous, a parallel coordinate plot is the most appropriate visualization tool for this type of data. Each of the six features was grouped by country and averaged over all years from 2010 to 2018, ignoring NAs. The rationale is as follows: It was shown from the facet plots previously that Year did not distinguish any trends. If every Country-Year combination is a line on the parallel coordinate plot, then it would require that none of the six features have NAs. This is too strong and may lead to underplotting given the amount of missing data in this dataset. This also ensures that every country also shows up only once or not at all. Observations: The two Education variables, Education Index and Mean Years of Schooling, are positively correlated. Therefore, analysis for this section will be made with Education Index only because the same conclusions will apply to Mean Years of Schooling. There is a large cluster of countries (Cluster 1) with low Inequality in Income (%), mid to high Inequality Adjusted Income Index, low Inequality in Education (%), and mid to high Education Index. For Cluster 1, theres a visible negative correlation between Inequality in Education (%) and Education Index. As Inequality-Adjusted Income Index is visibly negatively correlated with Inequality in Education (%) in Cluster 1, it can be inferred that the former is positively correlated with Education Index. There is another cluster of countries (Cluster 2) exhibiting the opposite trend. This cluster of countries has low to mid Inequality Adjusted Income Index, high Inequality in Education (%), and low-mid Education Index. For countries in Cluster 2, there is no obvious negative correlation between Inequality-Adjusted Income Index - Education Index and Inequality in Education (%) - Education Index like in Cluster 1. Cluster 1 has a visible right skew in Inequality in Education (%) and a slight left skew in Education Index, while countries in Cluster 2 exhibit no significant skew for these two features compared to Cluster 1. 5.4 Inequality versus Human Security (2010 - 2018) This section details the analysis of Inequality versus Human Security given the following variables: Inequality Inequality-Adjusted Income Index Inequality in Income (%) Inequality in Education (%) Inequality in Life Expectancy (%) Human Security Homicide Rate (per 100,000 people) Prison Population (per 100,000 people) First, Inequality variables were contrasted against Human Security variables in a scatterplot, faceted by year from 2010 to 2018 (again, the only years Inequality data were collected). The association between the Inequality variables (Inequality-Adjusted Income Index, Inequality in Income, Inequality in Education, and Inequality in Life Expectancy) is discussed in the Inequality variable selection, above. Similarly, the association between the Human Security variables (Homicide Rate and Prison Population) are discussed in the Human Security variable selection, above. Prison Population seems to show low positive correlations with two Inequality variables: Inequality-Adjusted Income Index and Inequality in Income (with correlation coefficients of .156 and .171, respectively). Interestingly, Prison Population shows negative correlations with both Inequality in Education and Inequality in Life Expectancy (-0.349 and -0.334, respectively). Homicide Rate shows low positive correlations with Inequality in Education and Inequality in Life Expectancy (with correlation coefficients of 0.127 and 0.142). Homicide Rate additionally shows correlations with Inequality-Adjusted Income Index, with a negative correlation of -0.324, and Inequality in Income, with a positive correlation of 0.488. The parallel coordinate plot, below, maps some of these associations. The above graph reorders variables to visualize new trends. There is a visual cluster of countries marked by a negative relationship between Inequality in Education and Prison Population, followed by a positive relationship between Prison Population and Inequality-Adjusted Income Index, and a negative relationship between Inequality-Adjusted Income Index and Inequality in Life Expectancy. Some of these countries continue to have what appears to be a direct relationship between Inequality in Life Expectancy and Homicide Rate. Within this cluster, countries demonstrate low Prison Population, high Inequality-Adjusted Income, and low Inequality in Life Expectancy. Some additionally demonstrate low Homicide Rate. To look at our data more closely, in our interactive component we create a finalized csv to be read into our plot.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion This study found a number of notable associations between variables, which motivate further research. Between Inequality and Human Security, both Homicide Rate and Prison Population showed significant associations. Homicide Rate demonstrated mid-strength correlations with Inequality-Adjusted Income Index (negative), and Inequality in Income (%) (positive). Prison Population showed mid-strength negative correlations with both Inequality in Education (%) and Inequality in Life Expectancy. Further, there appears to be a cluster of countries that demonstrate low Prison Population, high Inequality-Adjusted Income Index, low Inequality in Life Expectancy, and low Homicide Rate. While outside the scope of this study, identifying the HDI rankings of the countries within this cluster may prove useful in future analysis. Additionally, future research into potentially confounding variables would assist in identifying policy implications; for example, research investigating possible association between racial or cultural homogeneity and Inequality in Income, Inequality in Life Expectancy, or Prison Population, associations between government infrastructure and Inequality in Income or Prison Population, etc. In regard to Human Security indices, the effect of Higher Education seems mixed. High Education appears to be associated with higher Prison Population; further research might investigate prison programs and the differences between incarceration and rehabilitation policies. Additionally, Homicide Rate trends low among highly educated countries, and demonstrates larger gaps between countries with education indices that fall below the international average. Many of the high outliers within the Homicide Rate data show relatively low education rates, though overall this pattern does not imply a strong relationship. Future research might involve case study analysis of outliers, or a more in-depth analysis of the trends among countries that fall below international averages for education. Finally, in regard to the Inequality and Education variables, this study found two distinct clusters with relationships across several variables. The first cluster (Cluster 1) demonstrates low Inequality in Income (%), mid to high Inequality Adjusted Income Index, low Inequality in Education (%), and mid to high Education Index. Within this cluster, Inequality in Education (%) is negatively correlated with Education Index, but Inequality Adjusted Income Index is positively correlated with Education Index. The second cluster (Cluster 2) shows low to mid Inequality Adjusted Income Index, high Inequality in Education (%), and low-mid Education Index. Within Cluster 2, there is no obvious negative correlation between Inequality Adjusted Income Index and Education Index or between Inequality in Education (%) and Education Index, as seen in Cluster 1. Future research might helpfully explore correlations (i.e. regional) between countries that lie in clusters 1 and 2. Such research might seek to address why countries in clusters 1 and 2, between the same variables, exhibit almost opposite correlation behavior. "]]
