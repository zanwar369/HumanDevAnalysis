The United Nations Development Programmes (UNDP) Human Development Report Office (HDRO) compiles this data for the purpose of tracking human well being in countries around the world. This data is used extensively by the HDRO in its (near) annual Human Development Report (HDR). The report highlights human development in large part using various the human development indices (HDI), derived metrics for measuring human development which takes into account factors beyond economics. However for this project, HDI will not be a principal part of the investigation. According to the Human Development Report 2019: Readers Guide, the data used, at least for the 2019 HDR, is collected from international data agencies with the mandate, resources, and expertise to collect national data on specific indicators. Based on the Statistical Acknowledgement section of the guide, the HDR data was aggregated by the HDRO from a large number of organizations that are reputable and specializes in the field from which the data was collected. For the 2019 HDR, these included international agencies like the World Health Organization, the World Bank, and many others. The HDRO also provides contact information, where available, for organizations it sourced HDR data from. The data available for download from UNDPs website linked in the first paragraph consists of 12 different indicators of human development (plus HDI) and for each indicator, there are a number of descriptive features of that indicator for which data is available. For example, there are 9 features which fall under the Demography indicator, ranging from Median age (years) to Young age (0-14) dependency ratio (per 100 people ages 15-64). For each feature, a data table, if available, is provided where the columns include HDI Rank (2018), Country, and one column for every year (i.e. 1990) for which data is aggregated. Every column except Country contains numerical data. The years for which data is available falls in the range from 1990 to 2018. For this project, we will be examining 3 of the 12 indicators: Inequality, Human Security, and Education, which has 15, 7, and 19 features respectively. These features will be investigated in further detail in subsequent sections. Investigation showed that there are a number of issues with this data set as summarized below: The Human Development Report 2019: Readers Guide note that due to data accessibility and processing methodology, there may be discrepancies in data between national and international agencies. While the data set contains data from 1990 to 2018, it does not consistently store data for this time frame for every feature for every indicator. For example, some features have data going back to 1990 but others only back to 2010. Even within the same indicator, difference features have data for different time intervals. Some features have data for each year, others every 5 years. Data for some feature do not have data in even time intervals. For example, Prison population (per 100,000 people) has data for years 2003, 2005, 2010, 2011 etc. As will be detailed in subsequent sections, the proportion of missing data is high for some countries. For certain feature - country combinations, 2018 data was not available and was filled with the data from the most recent available year. It was not explicitly stated in the source documentation, but given that the data is collected from 1990-2018 and aggregated from numerous sources, it is possible that there lacks consistency in data collection and computation of certain metrics over time. For instance, method of calculating the HDI is continuously being adjusted. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Inequality Data Transformation 3.2 Education Data Transformation 3.3 Complete Data", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In order to work with the amount of data we split the work into three separate buckets Human Security, education, and inequality. We all performed similar transformations detailed below. 3.1 Inequality Data Transformation The Inequality indicator has 15 features from years 2010 to 2018 (one column per year). However, the data table for 6 of these features were not available for download. The remaining 9 features for which data tables were available and was extracted were: Coefficient of Human Inequality Inequality-adjusted education index Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) Inequality-adjusted income index Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index Inequality in education (%)^ Inequality in income (%)^ Inequality in life expectancy (%) Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%) ^ Data for 2018 is either from 2018 or the latest year available. Note that the column HDI Rank (2018) is kept as a reference column and not for analysis. First all of the files are read parsing through the inequality directory, and using read.csv to read in the relevant raw data files for each variable. Now to take a high level look at the data itself, print the head and tail of one of the dataframes in the list inequality_list, in this case the dataframe containing data for the Inequality in education (%) as a sample: ## # A tibble: 6 x 11 ## `HDI Rank (2018~ Country `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017` `2018` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 170 Afghan~ 39.3 39.3 39.3 45.0 44.8 44.8 45.4 45.4 45.4 ## 2 69 Albania 12.7 11.9 11.9 11.9 11.9 11.9 9.1 8.5 12.3 ## 3 82 Algeria .. .. .. .. .. .. 33.7 33.7 33.7 ## 4 36 Andorra .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 9.4 10.0 ## 5 149 Angola 26.2 .. 34.6 34.6 34.6 34.6 34.3 34.3 34.3 ## 6 48 Argent~ 12.1 12.1 12.1 8.6 8.1 8.1 6.1 6.2 6.2 ## # A tibble: 6 x 11 ## `HDI Rank (2018~ Country `2010` `2011` `2012` `2013` `2014` `2015` `2016` `2017` `2018` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &lt;NA&gt; Small ~ 27.6 29.6 30.1 22.0 21.1 20.5 19.9 19.6 19.7 ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; Organi~ 8.4 9.0 9.6 10.2 9.5 9.5 10.0 8.3 8.2 ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; World 26.2 26.3 27.0 27.2 26.9 25.9 25.7 22.3 17.4 ## 4 a: See http://h~ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 b: Data refer t~ &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Inspection of the remaining data frame indicate that the last rows for every data frame in inequality_list are NA. In addition, some data frames have foot notes at the end of the table that was read in as a value in the first column. These rows are removed. The below shows that the number of rows in the data frame for each feature is different. This implies not every feature has the same list of countries. ## [1] &quot;Coefficient of Human Inequality feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted education index feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted income index feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality in education (%) feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality in income (%) feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Inequality in life expectancy (%) feature has 208 rows and 11 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%) feature has 206 rows and 11 columns.&quot; To investigate this further: ## [1] &quot;Nauru&quot; &quot;Tuvalu&quot; ## [3] &quot;Korea (Democratic People&#39;s Rep. of)&quot; &quot;Somalia&quot; It looks like these four countries shows up for some features and not others. We can expect a lot of missing data for at least these four countries. The next step is to create a single tidy dataframe for Inequality. Each data frame in inequality_list has column headings 2010 to 2018 which are values not variables. In addition, each data frame in inequality_list is from the same observational unit (Inequality) and should be in one data frame. To convert the list of data frames inequality_list into a single tidy data frame, use pivot_longer and full_join to create the tidy data frame inequality_df. ## # A tibble: 6 x 12 ## `HDI Rank (2018~ Country Year `Coefficient of~ `Inequality-adj~ `Inequality-adj~ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 170 Afghan~ 2010 .. 0.226 .. ## 2 170 Afghan~ 2011 .. 0.227 .. ## 3 170 Afghan~ 2012 .. 0.237 .. ## 4 170 Afghan~ 2013 30.0 0.219 0.333 ## 5 170 Afghan~ 2014 30.0 0.223 0.335 ## 6 170 Afghan~ 2015 30.4 0.224 0.334 ## # ... with 6 more variables: `Inequality-adjusted income index` &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index` &lt;chr&gt;, `Inequality in education ## # (%)` &lt;chr&gt;, `Inequality in income (%)` &lt;chr&gt;, `Inequality in life expectancy ## # (%)` &lt;chr&gt;, `Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%)` &lt;chr&gt; Note that the columns of inequality_df are currently all of type &lt;chr&gt; when only Country should be of type &lt;chr&gt;, Year should be of type integer, and the remaining be of type numeric. This is because missing values are given as .. instead of NA. Convert the relevant columns to numeric which coerces .. to NAs in the process. ## # A tibble: 6 x 12 ## `HDI Rank (2018~ Country Year `Coefficient of~ `Inequality-adj~ `Inequality-adj~ ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 170 Afghan~ 2010 NA 0.226 NA ## 2 170 Afghan~ 2011 NA 0.227 NA ## 3 170 Afghan~ 2012 NA 0.237 NA ## 4 170 Afghan~ 2013 30 0.219 0.333 ## 5 170 Afghan~ 2014 30 0.223 0.335 ## 6 170 Afghan~ 2015 30.4 0.224 0.334 ## # ... with 6 more variables: `Inequality-adjusted income index` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Inequality in education ## # (%)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Inequality in income (%)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Inequality in life expectancy ## # (%)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%)` &lt;dbl&gt; To complete the data transformation, notice that under Country, the last 17 rows of each data frame contain aggregate data regional data, and are not countries: ## [1] &quot;Human Development&quot; ## [2] &quot;Very high human development&quot; ## [3] &quot;High human development&quot; ## [4] &quot;Medium human development&quot; ## [5] &quot;Low human development&quot; ## [6] &quot;Developing Countries&quot; ## [7] &quot;Regions&quot; ## [8] &quot;Arab States&quot; ## [9] &quot;East Asia and the Pacific&quot; ## [10] &quot;Europe and Central Asia&quot; ## [11] &quot;Latin America and the Caribbean&quot; ## [12] &quot;South Asia&quot; ## [13] &quot;Sub-Saharan Africa&quot; ## [14] &quot;Least Developed Countries&quot; ## [15] &quot;Small Island Developing States&quot; ## [16] &quot;Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&quot; ## [17] &quot;World&quot; Therefore, they will be removed from inequality_df.

This was done in a similar fashion to the inequality, and education data manipulations. This required removing blank columns (which had been left in the .csv files for visual appeal) and renaming columns to prime them for the pivot_longer function. Then, to ensure that all missing data were coded appropriately, a for loop was introduced to convert all numeric data columns in the dataset into numeric type. The result is a tidy dataset of all Human Security variables. Homeless.natural.disaster &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./HumanSecurity/Homeless.natural.disaster.csv&quot;) Homicide.rate &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./HumanSecurity/Homicide.rate.csv&quot;) Prison.popn &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./HumanSecurity/Prison.population.csv&quot;) Refugees &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./HumanSecurity/Refugees.csv&quot;) Suicide.rate.M &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./HumanSecurity/Suicide.rate.M.csv&quot;) Suicide.rate.F &lt;- read.csv(&quot;./HumanSecurity/Suicide.rate.F.csv&quot;) First the blank and extraneous rows are removed from each dataset, and the column names are converted to reflect the year each measurement was taken. names(Homeless.natural.disaster)[2:30] &lt;- c(&quot;1990&quot;, &quot;1991&quot;, &quot;1992&quot;, &quot;1993&quot;, &quot;1994&quot;, &quot;1995&quot;, &quot;1996&quot;, &quot;1997&quot;, &quot;1998&quot;, &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;2000&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2002&quot;, &quot;2003&quot;, &quot;2004&quot;, &quot;2005&quot;, &quot;2006&quot;, &quot;2007&quot;, &quot;2008&quot;, &quot;2009&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2011&quot;, &quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2013&quot;, &quot;2014&quot;, &quot;2015&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2017&quot;, &quot;2018&quot;) Homicide.rate &lt;- subset(Homicide.rate, select = -c(X, X.1, X.2, X.3, X.4, X.5, X.6, X.7, X.8, X.9, X.10)) names(Homicide.rate)[2:13] &lt;- c(&quot;1990&quot;, &quot;1995&quot;, &quot;2000&quot;, &quot;2005&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2011&quot;, &quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2013&quot;, &quot;2014&quot;, &quot;2015&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2017&quot;) Prison.popn &lt;- subset(Prison.popn, select = -c(X, X.1, X.2, X.3, X.4, X.5, X.6, X.7, X.8, X.9)) names(Prison.popn)[2:11] &lt;- c(&quot;2003&quot;, &quot;2005&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2011&quot;, &quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2013&quot;, &quot;2014&quot;, &quot;2015&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2017&quot;) Refugees &lt;- subset(Refugees, select = -c(X, X.1, X.2, X.3, X.4, X.5, X.6, X.7, X.8, X.9)) names(Refugees)[2:11] &lt;- c(&quot;2003&quot;, &quot;2005&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2011&quot;, &quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2013&quot;, &quot;2014&quot;, &quot;2015&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;, &quot;2017&quot;) Suicide.rate.F &lt;- subset(Suicide.rate.F, select = -c(X, X.1, X.2)) names(Suicide.rate.F)[2:5] &lt;- c(&quot;2000&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2015&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;) Suicide.rate.M &lt;- subset(Suicide.rate.M, select = -c(X, X.1, X.2)) names(Suicide.rate.M)[2:5] &lt;- c(&quot;2000&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2015&quot;, &quot;2016&quot;) Then, the numeric data columns are converted to numeric type. Note that all columns are originally in character type. Converting to numeric type both eases analysis and allows the blank entries, denoted as .. to be read as empty (NA). Finally, the data are converted to a tidy format and merged. 3.2 Education Data Transformation The following are the columns in the education dataset: Education Index Expected years of schooling (years) Expected years of schooling, female (years) Expected years of schooling, male (years) Government expenditure on education (% of GDP) Gross enrollment ratio, pre-primary (% of preschool-age children) Gross enrollment ratio, primary (% of primary school-age children) Gross enrollment ratio, secondary (% of secondary school-age children) Gross enrollment ratio, tertiary (% of tertiary school-age children) Literacy rate, adult (% ages 15 and older) Mean years of schooling (years) Mean years of schooling, female(years) Mean years of schooling, male (years) Percentage of primary schools with access to the internet Percentage of secondary schools with access to the internet Population with at least some secondary education (% ages 25 and older) Population with at least some secondary education, female (% ages 25 and older) Population with at least some secondary education, male (% ages 25 and older) Primary school dropout rate (% of primary school cohort) Primary School teachers trained to teach (%) Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) score in mathematics Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) score in reading Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) score in science Pupil-teacher ratio, primary school (number of pupils per teacher) Survival rate to the last grade of lower secondary general education (%) ^ Data for 2018 is either from 2018 or the latest year available. Note that the column HDI Rank (2018) is kept as a reference column and not for analysis. In order to read in, and transform the education data, the method is again similar to the previous two examples. Every file is found, and read from the relevant Education directory. With this data wew determine the relevant NAs in the files, and code those as such. Similarly, we skip the first lines in the files which are blank. Then we remove any rows that are irrelevant specifically the rows with footnotes. Finally, we remove additional columns, and change data types if necessary, and are then ready to transform the data into tidy format. Once the files are read in correctly we create two separate forms of the data. One with each variable as a column, and year as its own signular column, utilizing the pivot longer and wider functions. The other method leaves relevant education vartiables in a singular column, and another column coresponding to their values. While the second format is not necessarily tidy-this will help look at missings across the data. # df_temp&lt;-subset(df_temp,!is.na(df_temp$HDI Rank (2018))) 3.3 Complete Data "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Inequality Missing Data 4.2 Human Security Missing Data 4.3 Education Missing Data", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Inequality Missing Data Below is a bar plot showing the count of missing data per feature. The above shows that for 7 of the 9 features, 20-25% of its entries are missing. Since there is only 9 years and 9 features, a heat map is an appropriate to visualize combinations of missing data between Year and the different features to see if theres any relationship in proportion of missing data for a specific feature across years (and vice versa). The above heat map is drawn such that the feature with the largest proportion of missing data is at the bottom. From the heat map, it looks like 2011 and 2012 have the highest rates of missing data for every features aside from Inequality in life expectancy (%) and Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index. However, note that the proportion of missing data peaks at around 0.3 and most feature-year combinations have proportion of missing data that are below 0.2, which are manageable. The below is the aggregate sum of number of missing entries over all features for each country, filtering only the countries with at least one missing entry. It looks like 100% of the data is missing for Saint Kitts and Nevis, Liechtenstein, and Dominica. In addition, &gt;87.5% of the data is missing for Nauru, Marshall Islands, Andorra, and Tuvalu. All of these countries are extremely small (most are islands) and it is possible that Inequality data is not collected nationally and/or data collection is not prioritized by the relevant international organizations. Due to the large volume of countries, a heat map is not an effective way to visualize the relationship in proportion of data missing between countries and features. A parallel coordinate plot was drawn instead to determine if theres any relationship between features and proportion of missing data for different countries. Most countries appear to not be missing data for Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index and Inequality in life expectancy (%) and when they do, both features are missing in similar proportions. For remaining features, at intervals of around 0.1 from 0 to 1, there are clusters of countries missing that proportion of data for each feature. There is a small number of countries missing data for most to all of the features (flat line at the top), these are likely the smaller countries found in the bar charts. For Coefficient of Human Inequality, Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%), and Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI), countries generally miss the same proportion of the data for all 3 features, indicating that they may be related. For Inequality-adjusted income index and Inequality in income (%), countries generally miss the same proportion of the data for these two features; they are likely related. In addition, countries generally are missing an equal to or smaller proportion of data for these two features than the 3 features mentioned in the previous bullet. For Inequality-adjusted education index and Inequality in education (%) countries generally miss the same proportion of the data for these two features; they are likely related. 4.2 Human Security Missing Data A significant proportion of data in the Human.Security dataframe is missing. Largely, this seems to be the product of uneven variable tracking. Homelessness due to natural disasters seems to be tracked in most countries on a yearly basis between 1990 and 2018. By contrast, Homicide rate was recorded only in 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and yearly from 2010 to 2017. As another exmaple, suicide rate for both males and females were recorded only in the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2016. ## [1] &quot;X1990&quot; &quot;X1991&quot; &quot;X1992&quot; &quot;X1993&quot; &quot;X1994&quot; &quot;X1995&quot; &quot;X1996&quot; &quot;X1997&quot; &quot;X1998&quot; &quot;X1999&quot; ## [11] &quot;X2000&quot; &quot;X2001&quot; &quot;X2002&quot; &quot;X2003&quot; &quot;X2004&quot; &quot;X2005&quot; &quot;X2006&quot; &quot;X2007&quot; &quot;X2008&quot; &quot;X2009&quot; ## [21] &quot;X2010&quot; &quot;X2011&quot; &quot;X2012&quot; &quot;X2013&quot; &quot;X2014&quot; &quot;X2015&quot; &quot;X2016&quot; &quot;X2017&quot; &quot;X2018&quot; ## [1] &quot;X1990&quot; &quot;X1995&quot; &quot;X2000&quot; &quot;X2005&quot; &quot;X2010&quot; &quot;X2011&quot; &quot;X2012&quot; &quot;X2013&quot; &quot;X2014&quot; &quot;X2015&quot; ## [11] &quot;X2016&quot; &quot;X2017&quot; ## [1] &quot;X2000&quot; &quot;X2010&quot; &quot;X2015&quot; &quot;X2016&quot; ## [1] &quot;X2000&quot; &quot;X2010&quot; &quot;X2015&quot; &quot;X2016&quot; Importantly, data also appears to be missing among outlying island countries and countries in the African continent. For example, the chart below notes missing Homicide data. A notable chunk of countries (obs. numbers 50-100) seem to be missing data between 1990 and 2005. However, the largest amount of missing data seems to be concentrated in observations 150 to 192, which includes Micronesia and many of the countries on and around the African continent (ie. Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal). This trend is not unknown in international data collection. Lower infrastructural development renders data collection difficult, and factors like human rights and humanitarian crises, political violence, and political instability can hinder data collection processes. 4.3 Education Missing Data There are 9.535^{4} missing observations across the variables, year and country. The following bar chart displaying an interesting yet confusing pattern. It looks like all countries have between 394 and 725. Keeping in mind the data spans 29 years, and 25 variables, this is sensible, though there doesnt seem to be much of a pttern to missing observations, though smaller countries seem partially more likely to have missing data. For this analysis we want the variables with the least missing values across Countries to have a complete analysis. Overall it looks like, we can already begin narrowing down some of our variables to the ones that have almost no missings across all countries such as education index, or mean years of schooling. Other interesting notes are that the formerYugoslav Republic of Macedonia seems to have all missing observations which is correct according to the original source data, and after a little digging is because it has been replaced by North Macedonia, and is likely a left over. Percent of students without access to internet seems to be reported by very few, and mostly developed countries. The percent of population with at least some secondary education also seems like a variable that is frequently reported. Breaking down the analysis a little further, it looks we should definitely focus on 2010 onwards gfiving the lack of data across countries on a consistent basis for singular years beforehand. It looks like the data was previously released in 5-year buckets. Interestingly breakding down the missing variables by year confirms what was seen previously. The most reliable variables will be Education Index, Mean Years of Schooling, and Expected Years of Schooling, according to the lower number of missings throughout the years, as well as population with some secondary education. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Variable Selection 5.2 Education Variable Selection 5.3 Inequality versus Education (2010 - 2018)", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Variable Selection 5.1.1 Inequality Variable Selection From Section 4.0 Missing Data, it was noted from the parallel coordinate plot of the Inequality indicator that the following sets of features had the same proportion of missing data for nearly every country, indicating that they may be related: Coefficient of Human Inequality, Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%), and Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) Inequality-adjusted income index and Inequality in income (%) Inequality-adjusted education index and Inequality in education (%) Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index and Inequality in life expectancy (%) A scatterplot matrix of all 9 features without the missing data is below and such that pairwise correlations between all features can be examined. The analysis will begin with the feature groups listed above with strong relationships in their missing data, then extend to the remaining feature variable pairs. First, look at the feature groups where missing data appear to be in equal proportions for most countries: Coefficient of Human Inequality, Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%), and Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI): The three pairwise correlation coefficients between these three features are 0.999, -0.954, and -0.950, showing that these three feature are highly correlated when the data is not missing. Inequality-adjusted income index and Inequality in income (%): Correlation coefficient of -0.644. Despite countries missing data for both feature consistently, the two feature do not appear to have as strong of correlation as other cases discussed. Inequality-adjusted education index and Inequality in education (%): The correlation coefficient is -0.942, showing that these two feature are highly correlated when the data is not missing. Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index and Inequality in life expectancy (%): The correlation coefficient is -0.976, showing that these two feature are highly correlated when the data is not missing. On the basis of the results above, the following features can be dropped without significant loss of information: Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%) - due to strong correlation with Coefficient of Human Inequality and the fact both share similar missing patterns. Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) - highly correlated with multiple features, especially Coefficient of Human Inequality and Overall loss in HDI due to inequality (%) (while also sharing the same missing pattern as the latter two). Inequality-adjusted education index - highly correlated with Inequality in education (%) when data is present and in terms of missing pattern. Inequality-adjusted life expectancy index - highly correlated with Inequality in life expectancy (%) when data is present and in terms of missing pattern. Looking at the pairplot of the 5 remaining variables, it is noted that even though they do not share the same missing patterns, Coefficient of Human Inequality is strongly correlated with 3 of the remaining features (absolute correlation coefficient of ~0.9). Therefore, this feature can also be dropped. As a result, the remaining Inequality features to be kept for analysis with other indicators are: Inequality-adjusted income index Inequality in income (%) Inequality in education (%) Inequality in life expectancy (%) 5.2 Education Variable Selection Initially we pull only the variables that had the lest missings as per the missings analysis.I then run ggpairs across these variables to determine if there is further narrrowing we can do in regards to select. Given that the variables are all relatively, highly correlated, it is decided to just take Education Index as the variable of comparions in the analysis of correlations across human development topics. 5.3 Inequality versus Education (2010 - 2018) This section will detail the analysis of Inequality versus Education indicators for features selected per the above: Inequality Inequality-adjusted income index Inequality in income (%) Inequality in education (%) Inequality in life expectancy (%) Education Education Index Mean Years of Schooling First, all Inequality variables were compared with all Education variables in a scatterplot, faceted by Year from 2010 to 2018 since those were the only years where Inequality data was available. It was noted that Year did not seem to separate the data as illustrated in the a sample facet plot below for Mean Year of Schooling versus Inequality in life expectancy (%). This was the case for every combination of variables. Since there are 6 features in total all of which are continuous, a parallel coordinate plot is the most appropriate visualization tool for this type of data. For each of the six features, group by Country and average the data over all Years from 2010 to 2018 ignoring NAs. The rationale is as follows: It was shown from the facet plots previously that Year did not distinguish any trends. If every Country-Year combination is a line on the parallel coordinate plot, then it would require that none of the six features have NAs. This is too strong and may lead to under plotting given the amount of missing data in this dataset. This also ensures that every country also shows up only once or not at all. Some observations: The two Education variables, Education Index and Mean Years of Schooling, is positively correlated. Therefore, analysis for this section will be made with Education Index and such analysis implicitly also applies to Mean Years of Schooling There is a large cluster of countries (call Cluster 1) with low Inequality in Income (%), mid to high Inequality Adjusted Income Index, low Inequality in Education (%), and mid to high Education Index. For Cluster 1, theres a visible negative correlation between Inequality in Education (%) and Education Index. Since for Cluster 1 Inequality Adjusted Income Index is visibly negatively correlated with Inequality in Education (%), it can be inferred that the former is positively correlated with Education Index. There is another cluster of countries (call Cluster 2) exhibiting the opposite trend. This cluster of countries has low to mid Inequality Adjusted Income Index, high Inequality in Education (%), and low-mid Education Index. For countries in Cluster 2, there is no obvious negative correlation between Inequality Adjusted Income Index - Education Index and Inequality in Education (%) - Education Index like in Cluster 1. Countries in Cluster 1 has a visible right skew in Inequality in Education (%) and a slight left skew in Education Index, while countries in Cluster 2 exhibit no significant skew for these two features compared to Cluster 1.
