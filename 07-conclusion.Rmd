# Conclusion

Inequality - found two distinct clusters that have relationships across several variables
Cluster 1:

* low "Inequality in Income (%)", mid to high "Inequality Adjusted Income Index", low "Inequality in Education (%)", and mid to high "Education Index". 

* "Inequality in Education (%)" is negatively correlated with "Education Index" but "Inequality Adjusted Income Index" is positively correlated with "Education Index".

Cluster 2:

* low to mid "Inequality Adjusted Income Index", high "Inequality in Education (%)", and low-mid "Education Index".

* no obvious negative correlation between "Inequality Adjusted Income Index" - "Education Index" and  "Inequality in Education (%)" - "Education Index" like in Cluster 1.
