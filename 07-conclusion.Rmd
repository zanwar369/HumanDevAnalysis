# Conclusion



 Human security vs. inequality:
 * "Homicide rate" has some association with "Inequality-adjusted income index" (negative correlation of -0.324), and "Inequality in income", with a positive correlation of 0.488.
* Among the 'Human security' variables, "Homelessness due to natural disaster" shows the strongest correlations with 'Inequality' variables.  "Homelessness due to natural disaster" demonstrates a strong positive correlation with "Inequality-adjusted income" (0.911), and strong negative correlations with "Inequality in education" and "Inequality in life expectancy" (-0.821 and -0.929, respectively).  Finally, "Homelessness due to natural disaster" also shows a mid-strength negative correlation with "Inequality in income" (-0.337).
* Certain clusters of countries show visual trends between variables: 
Another cluster (Cluster 2) shows low "Inequality in life expectancy", high "Homelessness from natural disaster", and low "Homicide rate".  Cluster 2 shows a visible positive correlation between "Inequality in life expectancy" and "Homelessness from natural disaster", as well as a visible negative correlation between "Homelessness from natural disaster" and "Homicide rate".  
* There is a cluster of countries (Cluster 3) marked by a negative relationship between "Inequality in education" and "Homicide rate".  Cluster 3 further shows a positive relationship between "Homicide rate" and "Inequality adjusted income index", and a negative relationship between "Inequality adjusted income index" and "Prison population".
